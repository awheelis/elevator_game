#Elevator environment for an AI engine 
This project was started in 2019, but never finished. </br> 
There isn't much documentation because, at the time, I was teaching myself Python and AI at the same time. </br>

env.py: script with an elevator simulation class. The goal was to use this environment to see how efficiently an AI could </br>
control an elevator. Could it do better than existing algorithms or at least better than a human?
